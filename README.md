# 📁 HR Employee Dataset — Exploratory Analysis

This project explores a dataset containing employee records from a U.S.-based company. The analysis addresses key human resources questions using Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib) in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

## 📊 Objectives

The notebook focuses on answering the following analytical questions:

1. **🧑‍💼 Manager vs. Performance Score**  
   Are there differences in employee performance scores depending on their manager?

2. **🌱 Recruitment Source vs. Tenure**  
   Which hiring sources produce employees with the longest average tenure?

3. **💍 Marital Status vs. Satisfaction**  
   Is there a relationship between marital status and job satisfaction?

4. **🎂 Age Distribution**  
   What is the current age structure of employed staff?

5. **🧓 Age vs. Special Projects**  
   Do older employees participate in more special projects?

## 📌 Key Insights

- Certain managers have a clear pattern in their employees' performance distributions.
